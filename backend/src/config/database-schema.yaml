# NBA DFS Database Schema
# This file describes the complete database structure for the AI assistant

# AVAILABLE TABLES OVERVIEW:
# 1. players - Core player data with projections, stats, salaries, and matchup metrics
# 2. slates - DFS contest slate information
# 3. lineups - Saved DFS lineups
# 4. lineup_players - Junction table linking players to lineups
# 5. chat_sessions - AI chat conversation sessions
# 6. chat_messages - Individual chat messages
# 7. team_defense_rankings - Team defensive efficiency, pace, and advanced stats (from ESPN)
# 8. team_defense_vs_position - Position-specific defensive rankings (DVP) (from HashtagBasketball)
#
# KEY MATCHUP ANALYSIS TABLES:
# - team_defense_rankings: Overall team defense quality (def_eff), pace, offensive efficiency
# - team_defense_vs_position: How each team defends each position (pts_allowed per position)
# - players.dvp_pts_allowed: Pre-joined DVP data for each player's matchup
# - players.opp_def_eff: Pre-joined defensive efficiency for each player's opponent
#
# IMPORTANT: All defensive data is auto-populated on slate load and pre-joined to players table!

    notes: |
      - DVP (Defense vs Position) shows position-specific matchup quality
      - pts_allowed is the key metric for DFS - higher is better for offense
      - Multi-position players (e.g., PG,SG) use their PRIMARY position (first listed)
      - Data is auto-populated from HashtagBasketball.com on slate load
      - Combined with team_defense_rankings.def_eff for complete matchup analysis

# Important Query Tips
query_tips:
  - "ALWAYS filter out injured players with: WHERE (injury_status IS NULL OR injury_status = '')"
  - "There is NO 'ACTIVE' status - healthy players have NULL or empty injury_status"
  - "For 'top tier' players, use salary >= 9000 or projected_points >= 45"
  - "For 'value plays', look for value >= 5.5 or value_gpp >= 6.0"
  - "Position filtering: use LIKE operator (e.g., WHERE position LIKE '%PG%')"
  - "High ownership = rostership >= 25, Low ownership = rostership <= 10"
  - "Team abbreviations: LAL, BOS, GSW, MIA, etc. (3-letter uppercase)"
  - "Always order by projected_points DESC or value DESC for best results"
  - "Great matchups: dvp_pts_allowed >= 45 (high) AND opp_def_eff > 118 (weak defense)"
  - "Tough matchups: dvp_pts_allowed <= 35 (low) OR opp_def_eff < 108 (elite defense)"
  - "DVP pts_allowed: Higher is better for offense (easier matchup)"
  - "opp_def_eff: Higher is better for offense (weaker defense to face)"
  - "For complete matchup analysis, check BOTH dvp_pts_allowed AND opp_def_eff"
  # Advanced metrics tips
  - "CASH GAMES: Filter by floor >= 30 AND volatility < 0.20 AND bust_probability < 25"
  - "GPP TOURNAMENTS: Sort by leverage_score DESC for maximum differentiation"
  - "Elite leverage plays: leverage_score >= 3.0 (low owned + high boom potential)"
  - "Safe plays: floor >= 30 AND volatility < 0.15"
  - "High ceiling plays: ceiling >= 50 AND boom_probability >= 25"
  - "Consistent producers: volatility < 0.15 (low variance)"
  - "Boom/bust candidates: volatility >= 0.30 (high variance, good for GPP if low owned)"
  - "Low bust risk: bust_probability < 20 (safe for cash)"
  - "High boom potential: boom_probability >= 30 (great for GPP)"
  - "leverage_score is THE PRIMARY metric for GPP optimization"
  - "Blowout risk > 0 means spread is >10 points (starters may get pulled early)"

# Strategy Insights
dfs_strategy:
  cash_games:
    focus: "Safety, high floor, low volatility, low bust risk"
    metrics: ["floor >= 30", "volatility < 0.20", "bust_probability < 25", "value >= 5.5"]
    sql_example: "WHERE floor >= 30 AND volatility < 0.20 AND bust_probability < 25 AND projected_minutes >= 28 ORDER BY floor DESC"
    explanation: "Cash games reward consistency. Prioritize high floors and low variance to minimize downside risk."

  gpp_tournaments:
    focus: "Upside, ceiling, leverage, differentiation, boom potential"
    metrics: ["leverage_score >= 3.0", "ceiling >= 50", "boom_probability >= 25", "rostership <= 15"]
    sql_example: "WHERE leverage_score >= 3.0 AND ceiling >= 50 AND boom_probability >= 25 ORDER BY leverage_score DESC"
    explanation: "GPPs reward differentiation. Target low-owned players with high boom probability for maximum leverage."

    sql_example: "WHERE leverage_score >= 3.0 AND boom_probability >= 20 AND rostership <= 10 ORDER BY leverage_score DESC"
    explanation: "leverage_score is calculated as (boom_probability × 100) / (ownership + 1). Higher = better GPP value."
